##  Overview  

This repository contains the full working solution for **Assignment 2** of the course *105.708 Data Acquisition and Survey Methods* at TU Wien. The assignment is divided into two parts:

- **Part A: Survey Development** â€“ Creating survey questions and defining clear research objectives.
- **Part B: Survey Analysis** â€“ Conducting exploratory, descriptive, and analytic analysis using R and presenting the results in an RMarkdown report and presentation slides.

All tasks are implemented in R with a clean, reproducible structure.

##  Objectives  

- Develop a valid and well-structured survey instrument  
- Collect both categorical and quantitative data  
- Analyze the responses using appropriate statistical methods  
- Interpret findings in the context of the defined research questions  
- Produce a clear and professional report and presentation

##  Research Questions  

1. Do students who use AI tools (like ChatGPT, Grammarly, etc.) complete academic tasks in less time while maintaining or improving the quality of their work compared to those who do not use AI tools?

2. Does the frequency of AI tool usage increase student motivation and engagement during study?

3. Do students who integrate AI tools into their study routines demonstrate better long-term retention of learned material?
